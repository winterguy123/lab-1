        <h1>An elite organization that serves Earth</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Created after the events of the Delaz conflict, the Titans were an elite unit within the Earth Federation tasked with the security of Earth. To this end, this organization was given autonomy to act without repercussion.

        <h2>The gryps Conflict</h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the Titans proved to be little better than the Zeon remnants. Tensions and anger at the treatment of spacenoids lead to the creation of the Anti-Earth Union Group, spawning another conflict that lead to the Titan's dissolution.
